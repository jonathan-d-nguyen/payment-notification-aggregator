script.py authenticates and retrieves emails sent from Venmo.
the html for one email is in result-email-source.html

help me modify script.py so that it extracts the text enclosed in the html within the <!-- actor name -->, <!-- amount -->, and <!-- note --> comments
in this example email, the actor name is "Matthew Boehmer Worth", the amount is "$3.00", and the note is "M BW is meetup name"

the latest output from script.py is within output.txt

please modify script.py so that it parses out the actor names, amounts, and notes for venmo emails within the past 3 days

I organize a soccer meet up.
We meet Mondays and Wednesdays and I collect three dollars in fees from each participant.
I received the fees either through Zelle, Venmo, or Apple Pay.
I receive emails from Zelle and Venmo when I get paid.
I receive a text message from Apple Pay when I get paid , my goal is to aggregate all these notifications into one place.
I want them all aggregated into an iOS reminders list.

Right now, I have a python script that authenticates into my email and pulls all Venmo emails.
I need help extracting the actor name, amounts, and notes from each Venmo email.
